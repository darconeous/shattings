SHAred + SeTTINGS = Shattings

Shattings is a collection of scripts and settings which improve my productivity at the terminal. YMMV.

Work in progress.

## Quick Install ##

Type:

    curl https://github.com/darconeous/shattings/raw/master/quick_start.sh | bash

Another good complement to shattings on MacOS X is [Homebrew](http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/).

    ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://gist.github.com/raw/323731/install_homebrew.rb)"
