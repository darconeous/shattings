# new-temp-secure-disk
# ====================
#
# This script creates a new temporary encrypted disk image
# with a completely random password and mounts it. The password
# is not saved in any way. Once the disk is unmounted, all
# information stored on it is effectively lost.
#
# This makes it useful for performing operations which create
# files that need to kept secure.
#
# This script only works on macOS.
