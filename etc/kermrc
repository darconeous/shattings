# .kermrc
#
# This file makes kermit slightly more usable by giving it good defaults.
# In fact, unless you have this file in ~/, there is no way to connect
# via serial using kermit from a single host command line.
#
# Connect to a device as follows:
#     [HOST]
#     sudo kermit -l /dev/ttyUSB0 -b 115200 -c
#
# Upload a file:
#     [REMOTE]
#     kermit -r
#     CTRL+\ C
#     [HOST]
#     send <filename>
#
# Download a file:
#     [REMOTE]
#     kermit -s <filename>
